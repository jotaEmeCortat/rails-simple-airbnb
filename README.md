# Simple AirBnB

Project developed during the [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon) Bootcamp Full Stack.

## Objective

Build a simple Airbnb clone (like [this one](https://rails-simple-airbnb.lewagon.com/)). These
should be all the user stories of our app:

- As a user, I can see all the available flats on our website
- As a user, I can post a flat to the website, specifying its name and address
- As a user, I can see detailed information of a given flat
- As a user, I can edit the details of a flat if I made a mistake
- As a user, I can delete a flat from the website, in case I donâ€™t want to rent it anymore
